    line: "Agreement This agreement is made by and between The fields (or \"Field\"
      in short), based at [companyAddress], and [contractorLegal] (or \"[contractor]\"
      in short), based at [contractorAddress]. With this agreement, [contractor] agrees
      to perform services for Field for the project tentatively titled '[projectName]'
      on the following terms and conditions.  Services and deadlines The services
      that [contractor] will perform for [projectName] include:  ... ... ... Field
      needs to approve the work resulting from [contractor]'s services before it is
      considered complete. Field will therefore try to continuously and clearly communicate
      what makes the work complete and will try to approve or disapprove the work
      resulting from the services as soon as possible. [contractor] is aware that
      minor adjustments and fixes to the work are also part of the services.  The
      deadline for [contractor] to complete the services is [workCompletedDate]. Together,
      Field and [contractor] can agree to set a new deadline or redefine the services
      to be performed for the existing deadline. When [contractor] becomes aware that
      [contractor] is unable to complete the services on the deadline, [contractor]
      will immediately notify Field. If [contractor] is unable to complete the services
      on the deadline and Field and [contractor] cannot agree on a new deadline, Field
      can decide to no longer use [contractor]\u2019s services.  If Field does not
      pay on time, [contractor] can delay deadlines with as many days as Field delays
      the owed payment. If Field wants [contractor] to perform services that are not
      listed above, Field and [contractor] can agree to add services to this agreement
      or sign a new agreement.  Compensation After Field has approved the work delivered
      by [contractor], Field agrees to pay [contractor] [paymentAmount] on [paymentDate].
      \ All amounts in this agreement are excluding VAT (value added tax). [contractor]
      will send invoices to receive payment(s) from Field, after which Field will
      make payment [paymentMethod] within 30 days of receiving an invoice. [contractor]
      will be responsible for all expenses made while performing the services under
      this agreement. Because [contractor] is not an employee of Field, [contractor]
      is not entitled to worker's compensation, retirement, insurance or other benefits
      afforded to employees of Field.  Rights to the work [contractor] will remain
      owner of the rights to the work resulting from the services for this agreement,
      but gives Field the rights to use and distribute the work as part of [projectName]
      [scopeOfRights]. These rights include all art, images, designs, audio, videos,
      code, typography, and text, as they are delivered to Field, but Field can make
      minor changes to the work if needed. The rights [contractor] gives to Field
      are non-exclusive, meaning that [contractor] still has the rights to use the
      work for projects other than [projectName] without permission from Field. Field
      may not use the work that [contractor] delivers to Field in projects other than
      [projectName] without written permission from [contractor]. If [projectName]
      is made for another company or if [projectName] is distributed through another
      company, publisher, or platform, Field can give that company the same rights
      to use and distribute the work as part of [projectName].  [contractor] will
      make sure that Field can make full use of the work, which means that [contractor]
      will only deliver work that [contractor] made, or work from others if it comes
      with a license that allows the work to be included in [projectName]. If [contractor]
      delivers work to Field that is claimed to infringe the rights of others, then
      [contractor] will defend Field against these claims, and [contractor] is responsible
      for all damages Field may suffer.  Field agrees to credit [contractor] in- and
      outside of [projectName] following the industry standard. [contractor] can showcase
      the work resulting from the services for [contractor]'s portfolio, but if [projectName]
      is still unreleased, [contractor] needs written permission from Field.  Confidential
      information [contractor] agrees not to disclose or use any confidential information
      of Field or [projectName] without Field's written permission, both during and
      after the term of this agreement. Confidential information is defined as information
      that Field has not made public.  In case of a disagreement Both Field and [contractor]
      cannot end the agreement without a good reason. In case of a disagreement, Field
      and [contractor] will do their best to respectfully resolve the disagreement.
      If Field and [contractor] cannot find a solution for their disagreement, and
      Field or [contractor] wants to end the agreement, they need to give a seven
      day deadline to get to a solution.  If Field and [contractor] did their best
      to resolve the disagreement during these seven days but could not come to a
      solution, this agreement can be ended, and any rights that Field already paid
      for before the disagreement stay with Field. Field and [contractor] can come
      to an additional agreement about rights that Field has not yet paid for.  In
      case of a lasting conflict and Field and [contractor] want to use arbitration
      or go to court, they can only do that in [jurisdiction] using the laws of [jurisdiction].
      \ Signatures Field and [contractor] have both signed every page of this agreement,
      and each have their own copy of the signed agreement for future reference. This
      agreement starts on the latest date that Field or [contractor] signs."
